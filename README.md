# JavaScript Core Concepts: Strings & Arrays

## Overview
This repository contains my practice notes and exercises on **JavaScript Strings and Arrays**.  
Focus is on **core concepts, problem solving, and logical understanding**, not competitive programming.

## ✅ Strings

### Topics Covered:
1. **Basic Operations**
   - `length`, indexing, accessing characters
   - `split()`, `join()`, `toUpperCase()`, `toLowerCase()`
   - `includes()`, `startsWith()`, `endsWith()`, `indexOf()`

2. **String Manipulation**
   - Capitalize first letter of each word
   - Reverse string
   - Check palindrome
   - Compress string (`"aaabbc"` → `"a3b2c1"`)

3. **Counting & Frequency**
   - Count vowels and consonants
   - Count occurrences of each character
   - Find first non-repeating character
   - Find most frequent character (and handle multiple letters)

4. **Anagram Check**
   - Convert to lowercase, trim, count characters, compare objects

5. **Duplicates**
   - Remove duplicates from string while keeping order

## ✅ Arrays

### Topics Covered Today:
1. **Basic Operations**
   - `length`, indexing, first & last element
   - Looping with `for..of` and `for` loops

2. **Array Computations**
   - Find **max** and **min**
   - Find **sum** and **average**
   - Remove duplicates
   - Find **second largest number**

3. **Array Manipulations**
   - **Right rotate array by 1**

4. nested loop

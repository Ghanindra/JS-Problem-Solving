# JavaScript Core Concepts: Strings & Arrays

## Overview
This repository contains my practice notes and exercises on **JavaScript Strings and Arrays**.  
Focus is on **core concepts, problem solving, and logical understanding**, not competitive programming.

## ✅ Strings

### Topics Covered:
1. **Basic Operations**
   - `length`, indexing, accessing characters
   - `split()`, `join()`, `toUpperCase()`, `toLowerCase()`
   - `includes()`, `startsWith()`, `endsWith()`, `indexOf()`

2. **String Manipulation**
   - Capitalize first letter of each word
   - Reverse string
   - Check palindrome
   - Compress string (`"aaabbc"` → `"a3b2c1"`)

3. **Counting & Frequency**
   - Count vowels and consonants
   - Count occurrences of each character
   - Find first non-repeating character
   - Find most frequent character (and handle multiple letters)

4. **Anagram Check**
   - Convert to lowercase, trim, count characters, compare objects

5. **Duplicates**
   - Remove duplicates from string while keeping order

Arrays
Topics Covered:

Basics

Print length, first element, last element

Loop through array (for...of, forEach)

Calculations

Find largest and smallest numbers

Sum and average of elements

Duplicates

Remove duplicate elements

Find duplicate elements

Order & Position

Print array in reverse

Rotate array right by 1 position

Merge two arrays

Frequency Counting

Count occurrences of each element using nested loops

Store results in objects or arrays

Sorting

Sort array in ascending order without using .sort()

Array Mutation

Remove element using splice

Update element using splice

Check existence using .includes()

Push/pop/unshift operations
 map,filter,reduce
 

 objects
